# AE 370 – Group Project 2  
Time-Varying Stiffness Beam Vibration Analysis

This repository contains the numerical implementation for AE 370 Group Project 2
at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. The project studies the transverse
vibration response of an Euler–Bernoulli cantilever beam with time-varying flexural
rigidity, focusing on natural-frequency evolution and resonance-crossing behavior.

## How to Run

1. Move to the project directory:
   cd GroupProject2

2. Run the main simulation:
   python main.py

3. Run the alternative driver (optional):
   python main2.py

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  

(Installed by default in most scientific Python environments.)
